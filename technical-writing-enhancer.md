# Technical Writing Enhancer

## Domain/Subject
Kubernetes container orchestration, specifically focusing on deployment strategies

## Purpose
To create a step-by-step tutorial explaining how to implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes for a production environment

## Technical Level
Intermediate - assume readers understand Kubernetes basics but may not have experience with advanced deployment strategies

## Content Requirements
- **Scope**: Cover the concept of blue-green deployments, Kubernetes-specific implementation details, and practical walkthrough. Exclude cluster setup and basic Kubernetes concepts.
- **Depth**: Provide detailed explanations of each command and configuration, including what each parameter does
- **Technical Details**: Must include YAML manifest examples, kubectl commands, and service configuration for traffic switching
- **References/Standards**: Follow Kubernetes official documentation terminology and best practices from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

## Structural Specifications
- **Format**: Step-by-step tutorial with explanatory sections
- **Sections**: 
  1. Introduction to blue-green deployments
  2. Prerequisites
  3. Setting up the initial deployment
  4. Creating the secondary environment
  5. Testing the new deployment
  6. Switching traffic
  7. Rollback procedures
  8. Best practices and common pitfalls
- **Length**: Comprehensive but concise, approximately 1500-2000 words
- **Visual Elements**: Include at least one diagram showing traffic flow during blue-green deployment, code blocks for all YAML manifests and commands

## Style Guidelines
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable, focus on practical guidance
- **Terminology**: Use proper Kubernetes terminology (e.g., "Deployments" not "apps", "Services" not "endpoints")
- **Examples**: Provide a realistic example application scenario (use a simple web application as the example)
- **Clarity Focus**: Extra clarity on service routing and how traffic is switched between environments

## My Technical Writing Prompt:
Write a tutorial on how to implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes.

## Key Enhancement Strategies for Technical Writing

1. **Specify technical domain precisely**: Be exact about the technical field or technology.
2. **Define the technical level clearly**: This ensures content matches the audience's expertise.
3. **Set clear scope boundaries**: Explicitly state what should be included and excluded.
4. **Request specific technical detail**: Mention particular concepts, commands, or elements to include.
5. **Define structural requirements**: Technical content benefits from clear organization.
6. **Specify documentation type**: Different technical formats have different conventions.
7. **Indicate terminology preferences**: Note specific technical terms to use or avoid.
8. **Request visual elements**: Diagrams and visual aids enhance technical understanding.
9. **Specify code requirements**: For programming topics, indicate language, style, and commenting preferences.
10. **Reference official standards**: Mention specific documentation or standards to adhere to.
