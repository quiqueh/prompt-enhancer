## Key Enhancement Strategies for Conversational Prompts

1. **Define the conversation type precisely**: Different conversation types have different conventions and expectations.
2. **Specify the role clearly**: The more detailed the role description, the more authentic the conversation.
3. **Establish knowledge boundaries**: Define what the AI should know or not know in the adopted role.
4. **Set relationship dynamics**: Clarify the relation between participants to guide tone and approach.
5. **Define conversation goals**: Having clear objectives helps keep the dialogue focused.
6. **Specify topics to include and avoid**: This provides guardrails for the conversation.
7. **Indicate preferred pacing**: Some exchanges benefit from quick responses, others from detailed ones.
8. **Request specific conversational techniques**: Such as Socratic questioning, motivational interviewing, etc.
9. **Define response format preferences**: How information should be structured in responses.
10. **Include role-specific language requests**: Special terminology, speaking style, or mannerisms.
